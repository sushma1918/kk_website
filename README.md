## ⚙️ Usage

### 🔄 Customization
- ✏️ **Content**: Edit the HTML files (e.g., `index.html`, `about.html`) to add your own text, images, and sections.
- 🎨 **Styles**: Modify `styles.css` for custom designs, colors, and typography.
- 🧩 **Bootstrap Components**: Use Bootstrap classes to add pre-built components like navbars, buttons, cards, and more.
  
### 📧 Contact Form (PHP)
The `contact.php` file handles form submissions. Make sure to configure the email settings for proper form processing.
- The contact form requires a working PHP server.
