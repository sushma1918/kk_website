        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Greetings to all my readers and viewers. I belong to a medium family and was born in a village Sauna Lachhuman in the district of Deoria, primarily known as Deoghar in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India.</p>
        <p>I got my primary education from my village primary school Sauna Lachhuman and had immense interest in speaking and learning English since those days. My father, a B.Sc. in Mathematics, always emphasized the importance of knowledge. He provided me with all the supplies, especially study materials. I have been a remarkable student in English from primary school to my Master’s degree in English.</p>
        <p>During my graduation from DDU University, Gorakhpur, I used to hold tuition for students from 9th to 12th and even for graduate students, under the name of MM Tutorials. I taught students of all boards, including CBSE, ICSE, and UP.</p>
        <p>In 2012, I resolved to open a CBSE school, which was established under the name of Knowledge King Academy. My brothers and I, all experts in different subjects, made this possible. From 2012 to 2018, Knowledge King Academy was the most renowned institute in the town of Hata, Kushinagar, educating super thirty batches to success.</p>
        <p>Later, I was selected as Area Business Manager for Burger King Company, Miami, Florida, USA, under the franchise of KSA (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia). Managing citizens of multiple nationalities, I represented myself as a global manager through the power of fluent English and logic, my god-gifted virtues.</p>
        <p>Presently, education methods have evolved. Traditional chalkboard teaching has been replaced with new technologies. Degrees may be easier to obtain, but true knowledge remains the key to success. My message to all is to be smarter in acquiring and retaining knowledge. Join <strong>Knowledge King Edu Pvt Ltd</strong> for complete education solutions and career development.</p>

        <p class="author">Thank you to all,</p>
        <p class="author">AK Sir</p>
